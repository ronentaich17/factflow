# FactFlow

This is the source code for my web application that shows users a curated list of fun facts based on their topic of interest.

Check out the website [here](factflowbyronen.netlify.app/)!

## Notes

The Supabase instance that powers the backend of FactFlow pauses itself when there is inactivity, so information may not appear when accessing the site. Please feel free to reach out if you want to see the contents of FactFlow and they are unavailable. Apologies in advance for the inconvenience.
